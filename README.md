adventures in text mining 

data source: http://lanic.utexas.edu/project/castro/db/

purpose: use lsa/lda/knn/svm/hierarchical clustering on various translations of same collection of texts into the same target language for purposes of identifying what George Lakoff calls frames

TO DO:

 * add comprehensive bibliography
 * compose procedure pseudocode that would identify volatile spots between multiple instances of same text collection
  * implement n-gram tokenization using RTextTools instead of tm, as it doesn't require RWeka's rJava dependency with its memory limits
  * also use unique function in RTextTools package to obtain k for topic model #: http://www.rtexttools.com/1/post/2011/08/getting-started-with-latent-dirichlet-allocation-using-rtexttools-topicmodels.html
